4. **Problem: Merging DataFrames**
    - Merge two Pandas DataFrames based on a common key column. Handle different types of joins and demonstrate the merged result.

5. **Problem: Time Series Analysis**
    - Load a time-series dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform basic time series analysis, including plotting trends and seasonality.

6. **Problem: Pivot Tables**
    - Create a pivot table from a given Pandas DataFrame, aggregating data based on multiple columns, and customize the table's structure.

### Matplotlib:

1. **Problem: Line Plot**
    - Plot a line graph using Matplotlib that shows the trend of a variable over time. Customize the plot with labels, title, and grid.

2. **Problem: Bar Chart**
    - Create a bar chart using Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. Customize colors and annotations.

3. **Problem: Scatter Plot**
    - Generate a scatter plot with Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between two variables. Customize the plot with labels and a regression line.

4. **Problem: Histogram**
    - Plot a histogram using Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. Customize bin sizes and colors.

5. **Problem: Subplots**
    - Create a Matplotlib figure with multiple subplots, each displaying a different aspect of a dataset (e.g., line plot, bar chart).

6. **Problem: 3D Plotting**
    - Plot a 3D surface plot using Matplotlib to visualize a mathematical function. Customize the plot with labels and a color map.

### re (Regular Expressions):
